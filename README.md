Conway's Game of Life in JS

# Conway's Game of Life Rules
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


# User Story: 
- When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
- I can start and stop the board.
- I can set up the board.
- I can clear the board.
- When I press start, the game will play out.
- Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
